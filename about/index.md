My academic interests include good old fashioned data structures and
algorithms, algorithms for approximating hard counting problems or
sampling from intractable probability distributions, representation
learning (and algorithms for solving the hard non-convex optimisation
problems this entails), Bayesian machine learning, statistical
language modelling and extracting information from unstructured data,
e.g. text.

As an engineer, I like good design, simple abstractions, and clean
modular implementations. At the moment most of my work is in Scala,
Java, and Lua (https://github.com/torch/torch7/), but at heart I'm a
polyglot, with experience in C, C++, Python, Clojure (and a little bit
of ruby, haskell, and javascript). My interests in efficient
computation have led me to GPGPU, where I have some experience writing
both OpenCL (the idealist in me prefers open standards) and CUDA (the
pragmatist in me acknowledges CUDA is still quite a bit ahead in terms
of libraries, especially for machine learning). I'm developing a
fondness for Agile and am a firm believer in Test-Driven Development
and rapid iteration.
