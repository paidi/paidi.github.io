Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher. I like good old fashioned
data structures and algorithms, algorithms for approximating hard
counting problems or sampling from intractable probability
distributions, C++, Lua, functional programming, software
architecture, representation learning (and algorithms for solving the
hard non-convex optimisation problems this entails), Bayesian machine
learning, statistical language modelling and extracting information
from unstructured data, e.g. text. At the moment, I am particularly
interested in automated knowledge base construction, building
knowledge bases for inference, weak supervision, the application of
Deep Learning to Natural Language Understanding, and writing
Lua/C/CUDA code with [Torch7](http://torch.ch)

After a (brief) career as a Theoretical Computer Science researcher, I
spent 3 great years writing C++ and Clojure, and thinking about
language models and efficient algorithms and data structures, on the
SDK Team at [SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.com). Since March 2015,
I've been a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher at
[Stratified Medical](http://www.stratifiedmedical.com), where I spend
a lot of my time trying to teach machines how to read scientific
articles.
